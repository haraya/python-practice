"""
Basic Arithmetic
Create two variables, a and b, and assign them any integer values.
Calculate and print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of these two numbers.

#Variables
a = 4
b = 7

#Formula
sum = a + b
difference = a- b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b

#Printing
print(f"""The result is:
Sum: {sum}
Difference: {difference}
Product: {product}
Quotient: {quotient}""")
